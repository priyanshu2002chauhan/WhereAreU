if yes, set option for high accuracy, a 5-second timeout, and no caching. Use watchPos to track the users location continuosly.

Initialise a map centred at coordinates (0,0) with a zoom level of 15 using LeafLet. Add OpenStreetMap tiles to the map.

Create an empty object markers



When recieving location  data via the socket, extract id, latitude, and longitude, and center map on the new coordinates.

If a marker for this id exists, update its position, otherwise, create a new marker at the given coordinates and add it to the map. When
a user disconnects, remove their marker from the map and delete it from markers.
